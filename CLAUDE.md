# CLAUDE.md — Flit (Mail Client)

Project memory for Claude Code. Read at the start of every session. Keep edits to this file deliberate.

## What we're building

A minimal, privacy-first desktop email client for macOS (multiplatform later), meant to replace Canary Mail. Plain IMAP/POP3 + SMTP and Gmail, multiple accounts, unified inbox. No feature bloat — a clean, fast client for reading and writing mail.

**Stack:** Tauri v2 (Rust backend + system webview frontend), Svelte 5 + TypeScript + Vite frontend, Rust backend in `src-tauri/`.

## Design goals — the north star. Every decision serves these.

1. **Privacy-first.** Local-first: data lives only in a local SQLite DB. No sync server, no telemetry, no phone-home. Secrets in the OS keychain, all network over TLS.
2. **Open-source.** Permissive dependencies, no proprietary lock-in. (License: decide MIT/Apache-2.0 vs GPL early.)
3. **Blazing fast.** Instant startup from local cache, parallel async account sync, lazy-loaded message bodies, virtualized message list.
4. **Clean UI.** "Nice" here means typography, density, consistent spacing, dark mode, and keyboard control — not effects.

## Hard rules — never violate

- **Email-body rendering is security-critical.** The webview that renders message HTML MUST have JavaScript disabled, MUST block remote resource loading by default (remote images = tracking pixels), and MUST sanitize the HTML. Render bodies in a sandboxed, isolated context (sandboxed iframe / restricted webview), never in the app's main frame. Treat any change to this path as a security change and flag it explicitly. Decided 2026-07-13: the webview itself NEVER loads remote content — remote images the user opts into (policy "always"/"ask", see `mail/remote.rs`) are fetched by the Rust backend (TLS-only, no cookies/Referer, known trackers stripped) and inlined as `data:` URIs. Decided 2026-07-19, the ONE sanctioned exception (user-approved): the compose editor may hold a reply's quoted original — only the `mail::sanitize::sanitize_fragment` output (scripts stripped, remote refs inert, images restricted to `data:`/`cid:` at the editor schema too), and only after the user explicitly expands the parked quote (••• toggle). Raw or unsanitized message HTML still never enters the main frame.
- **Secrets never hit disk in plaintext.** Account passwords and OAuth tokens go in the macOS Keychain (`keyring` crate). Never write credentials or tokens to plaintext files, logs, or the SQLite DB.
- **All network I/O over TLS.**
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no external calls** other than the user's own mail servers, (later) the OAuth provider, user-initiated remote-image loading (decided 2026-07-13; `mail/remote.rs`, default remains blocked/ask), and sender-domain avatar lookups (decided 2026-07-31; `mail/avatars.rs`, **default off**). The avatar exception is narrow and stays that way: the lookup key is the sender's **domain, never an address or a hash of one**, results are cached per domain (hits 30 days, misses 7) so a domain is contacted at most once per window, and fetching is batched at list load — never tied to opening a message, which would make it a tracking pixel. Per-address services (Gravatar and friends) are out: they would leak who the user corresponds with, not merely which organisations write to them. Decided 2026-09-14, the fourth and last sanctioned host: **model downloads for the experimental on-device summaries** (`llm/download.rs`, `llm/catalog.rs`). Only when the user clicks Download on a specific catalog model in Settings → Experimental — the feature switch alone contacts nothing. Each catalog entry pins an exact URL (repository revision) and SHA-256 on huggingface.co; the file is fetched once over TLS with no cookies or Referer, verified, and kept in the app data folder. Nothing about the user's mail is ever sent: summaries run entirely on the local model and no message text leaves the machine.

## Development workflow

- **Always follow the `workflow` skill**: test-first, small atomic commits, every commit
  green. Never batch a whole feature into one commit.
- **Use the `stack` skill** for environment setup, running the app, Rust↔Svelte IPC
  patterns, and troubleshooting.
- Propose a plan before non-trivial changes; wait for review before executing.
- **Commits land directly on main** — push after every green commit
  (`git push origin HEAD:main` from a worktree). No feature branches or PRs
  unless explicitly requested.
- Never change a Hard Rule without flagging it explicitly.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Run the desktop app (dev) | `npm run tauri dev` |
| Frontend only in browser | `npm run dev` |
| Build release app | `npm run tauri build` |
| Frontend tests | `npm test` |
| Frontend type/lint check | `npm run check` |
| Rust tests | `cargo test` (run in `src-tauri/`) |
| Engine smoke test against a real model | `FLIT_TEST_MODEL=<path>.gguf cargo test llm::engine -- --ignored` |
| Rust lint | `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (in `src-tauri/`) |
| Rust format | `cargo fmt` (in `src-tauri/`) |
| Regenerate app icons | `npm run tauri icon -- icon.svg` |
| Regenerate the macOS 26+ Liquid Glass icon | `scripts/build-icon-assets-car.sh` |

The app icon's source of truth is `icon.svg` in the repo root; everything under
`src-tauri/icons/` is generated from it. Edit the SVG, never the PNGs. The
generator also writes `icons/android/` and `icons/ios/` — gitignored, this is a
desktop app.

**macOS 26 (Tahoe) Liquid Glass icon:** `src-tauri/icons/AppIcon.icon/` is a
separate, hand-authored Icon Composer source (foreground glyph only — no
squircle/background, macOS composites that from `icon.json`'s
`automatic-gradient` fill plus its own glass/shadow treatment). It compiles to
`src-tauri/icons/AppIcon.car`, which `tauri.conf.json`'s `bundle.icon` lists
directly — **not** the `.icon` source. Run
`scripts/build-icon-assets-car.sh` after editing `AppIcon.icon/` and commit
the regenerated `.car`.

Why pre-built instead of letting Tauri compile it: Tauri (≥2.11) can compile a
`.icon` source into `Assets.car` during `tauri build` via `actool`, but on
this machine `actool` (invoked through the cargo/tauri-cli process tree)
crashes deterministically with an internal `NSPlaceholderArray`/nil-object
exception in `ibtoold`, its asset-compiler XPC daemon. The exact same
`actool` invocation against the exact same files succeeds every time when run
directly from an interactive shell (which is what the script does — it also
kills any stale `ibtoold` first, another flaky-XPC-daemon symptom). Without
the `.icns` fallback (`CFBundleIconFile`, still generated from `icon.svg`),
pre-Tahoe macOS would show no icon at all.

`npm run tauri` goes through `scripts/tauri.sh`, which loads `.env` (see
`.env.example`) and signs macOS builds — dev binaries and release bundles alike
— with the local `flit-dev` identity, so the Keychain stops re-asking on every
rebuild. Machines without that identity fall back to ad-hoc signing.

The Rust build compiles llama.cpp from source (`llama-cpp-2`, for the experimental
on-device summaries) and therefore needs `cmake` — see the `stack` skill for
installing it without Homebrew.

All of `npm run check` + `npm test` + `cargo test` + `cargo clippy` must pass before any commit.

## Code conventions

- **Simplicity over cleverness.** This is a small app. Prefer the straightforward solution. Do NOT add abstraction (traits, generics, extra layers, "provider frameworks") until there's a concrete present need — usually the third real use, not the first. A little duplication beats the wrong abstraction. If you're about to build a framework, stop and ask.
- **Idiomatic, not inventive.** Write idiomatic Rust and idiomatic Tauri; follow established community conventions. Don't design novel architecture. When unsure of the idiomatic pattern, fetch current docs (see Tooling) instead of guessing.
- **Errors:** return `Result<T, E>`, use `?`. Define a small app error enum with `thiserror`. `#[tauri::command]` functions return a `Result` with a serializable error so the frontend can handle failure. No `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` on fallible runtime paths.
- **Async for all I/O** (IMAP, SMTP, DB). Fetch multiple accounts in parallel, never sequentially.
- **Svelte 5 runes** (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`). Do NOT emit Svelte 4 reactive syntax (`$:`). Keep components small.
- **Explain non-obvious decisions.** The maintainer is new to Rust and reviews to learn. When you make a non-trivial ownership/lifetime/async/architecture choice, say why (a short chat note or a `// why:` comment). Comment the *why*, not the *what*.

## Architecture — keep it exactly this simple

**Backend (`src-tauri/src/`):**

- `main.rs` / `lib.rs` — boots Tauri, registers commands, builds shared state.
- `state.rs` — `AppState` managed by Tauri (DB pool, per-account sessions/config). The app's shared state.
- `commands/` — the `#[tauri::command]` functions. The ONLY API surface the frontend calls. Keep them thin: validate input, call a module, return `Result`. No business logic here.
- `mail/` — IMAP/SMTP: connect, fetch headers/bodies, send, flags; MIME parsing.
- `storage/` — SQLite: schema, queries, cache.
- `auth/` — credentials, OAuth2, Keychain access.
- `models.rs` — shared structs (`Account`, `MessageHeader`, `Message`) serialized to the frontend.

**Frontend (`src/`):**

- Three-pane layout: sidebar (accounts + unified inbox) / message list / message body.
- Talks to the backend ONLY via `invoke('command_name', {...})`.
- State in Svelte runes/stores. No business logic in the frontend — it renders and calls commands.
- Mirror command payload types in `src/lib/types.ts` and keep them in sync with `models.rs`.

**Data model (multi-account from day one):**

- Every message row carries `account_id`.
- Unified inbox is not a special table — it's a query across all accounts, merged, sorted by date desc.
- Compose tracks the "From" account: reply → the account it arrived on; new mail → default account + a switcher.

## Non-goals — do not build unless explicitly asked

Full-text search, snooze, rules/filters, PGP, calendar. Out of scope until the core read / write / multi-account flow is solid. (Send-later was pulled out of this list and built 2026-07-16 — local scheduler in `src-tauri/src/scheduler.rs`; missed sends never auto-send, the user confirms in a catch-up dialog. Threading/conversation view was pulled out and built 2026-07-17 — References/In-Reply-To based, thread keys computed at insert in `storage/messages.rs`, no subject fallback; flat Gmail-style conversation, accordion detail view; trash/junk/drafts views stay flat. IMAP IDLE/push was pulled out and built 2026-07-27 — `src-tauri/src/idle.rs`, opt-in via the `push_enabled` setting, one connection per account watching the inbox, re-IDLE every 29 min, capped backoff; servers without IDLE fall back to polling. The poller stays: under push its interval is the cadence for the folders IDLE cannot watch. On-device summaries were built 2026-09-14 as an Experimental setting — `src-tauri/src/llm/`: a static model catalog pinned by revision + SHA-256, download only on an explicit click, `llama-cpp-2` engine on its own thread with idle unload, message and conversation prompts that treat mail as untrusted material, a hashed summary cache, streamed tokens with cancel. Output is plain text only, never HTML; the buttons appear only while the switch is on and the picked model is on disk.)

## Backend crates (baseline)

`async-imap`, `lettre` (SMTP), `mail-parser` (MIME), `oauth2`, `rusqlite` or `sqlx` (SQLite), `keyring` (Keychain), `tokio`, `thiserror`, `serde`. **Confirm current versions and APIs via Context7 before writing code against any crate — do not rely on training data for crate APIs.**

## Tooling — use these, don't guess APIs

- **Context7 MCP** (when connected): fetch current, version-specific docs for Rust crates and libraries before coding against them. If not connected in the session, verify against docs.rs / official docs instead of training data.
- **Svelte MCP** (when connected): use for Svelte 5 / SvelteKit docs, and run its autofixer on Svelte code before finishing. Never emit Svelte 4 syntax.
- For Tauri, prefer current **Tauri v2** docs — Tauri v1 patterns are common online and wrong for this project.

## Build order — one phase at a time, commit after each

0. **Skeleton** — three empty panes, mock data, prove `invoke()` round-trips.
1. **Account model + storage** — SQLite schema with `account_id`; account CRUD; Keychain for secrets. (Before any real fetching.)
2. **Read path** — one IMAP account: fetch headers → list → click → body in the sandboxed webview (JS off, remote images blocked). Also: connection check in the add-account flow ("Verify & Save" — IMAP TLS connect + LOGIN, SMTP connect; save only on success). Decided 2026-07-08: phase 1 stores accounts unverified.
3. **Multi-account + unified inbox** — parallel fetch, merge, "All Inboxes" view.
4. **Write path** — compose, reply (correct From), send via SMTP.
5. **Gmail OAuth2** — Google Cloud app (testing mode), XOAUTH2. Only after plain IMAP works.
6. **Actions** — read/unread, delete, archive, synced back to the server.
7. **Polish** — typography, spacing, dark mode, keyboard shortcuts (j/k, Cmd+Enter to send).
